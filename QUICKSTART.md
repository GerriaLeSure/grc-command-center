```

## üìà Key Metrics to Track

### Risk Management
- Total risks and distribution by level
- Average inherent vs residual risk scores
- Risk reduction percentage
- Open vs closed risks

### Control Effectiveness

2. Run gap analysis for each framework
3. Address critical gaps
4. Update requirement status
5. Collect missing evidence

### Annual Vendor Assessment
1. Generate list of vendors due for assessment
2. Send questionnaires
3. Review responses
4. Calculate risk scores
5. Update vendor risk levels
6. Plan remediation for high-risk vendors

### Audit Preparation
1. Export all risks, controls, and evidence
2. Run compliance calculations
3. Generate gap analysis reports
4. Collect supporting documentation
5. Review with audit team

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Services won't start
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

### Can't access frontend
- Ensure port 3000 is not in use
- Check: http://localhost:3000
- View frontend logs: `docker-compose logs frontend`

### Can't access backend API
- Ensure port 8000 is not in use
- Check: http://localhost:8000/health
- View backend logs: `docker-compose logs backend`

### Database connection errors
```bash
# Restart database
docker-compose restart postgres

# Check database is running
docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready -U grc_user
```

## üìö API Examples

### Create a Risk via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/risks/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Data Breach Risk",
    "description": "Risk of unauthorized data access",
    "category": "Technology",
    "likelihood": "LIKELY",
    "impact": "MAJOR",
    "owner": "CISO"
  }'
```

### Get Risk Heatmap
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/risks/analytics/heatmap | json_pp
```

### Get Compliance Dashboard
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/compliance/dashboard | json_pp
```

### Get KPIs
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/dashboard/metrics/kpis | json_pp
```

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Update risk and control status weekly
2. **Evidence Collection**: Automate where possible
3. **Vendor Assessments**: Schedule recurring assessments
4. **Compliance Tracking**: Review dashboards daily
5. **Documentation**: Keep descriptions detailed
6. **Ownership**: Assign owners to all items
7. **Integration**: Connect to your existing tools
8. **Backups**: Run daily database backups
